        <h3>ABOUT</h3>
          <p>Dan Brown is a prolific author of several #1 bestselling novels. Most noted for his work on the Robert Langdon series, some of his novels have gone on to become feature films featuring Academy Award winner Tom Hanks. The genre of Brown's novels generally follow the mystery thriller theme that keeps readers in suspense and always feeling as though they are part of the adventure. Brown novels are published in 56 languages across the globe with over 200 million copies in print.</p>
        <h3>EARLY LIFE</h3>
          <p>Born on June 22, 1964, Dan Brown was the oldest of three children who grew up in Exeter, New Hampshire. He attended Amherst College and graduated with a degree in English and Spanish. Brown attempted to pursue a career in music but despite his efforts, decided to turn to teaching where he began his writing career after reading a copy of Sidney Sheldon's "Doomsday Conspiracy". In 1998, Brown published his first thriller, <em>Digital Fortress</em>, about the NSA's invincible code-breaking machine that couldn't break a code which unraveled a mystery behind the events that followed. From then on his career took off as a successful writer within the mystery thriller genre.</p>
        <h3>CAREER</h3>
          <p>In March of 2003, Brown published <em>The Da Vince Code</em> which sold 6,000 copies on the first day and soared to the top of the New York Times' Best Seller list in its first week. Its success centered around an ingenious plot that tied into historical and biblical research so well and captivated readers creating an immersion that successfully lead to a prequel novel and several sequel novels. These stories revolved around a professor named Robert Langdon who found himself tangled in various plots requiring historic knowledge that only he could be of assistance to. These novels became such a success that they were eventually turned into feature films. Brown has received high praise for his success in writing and was named one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World by TIME Magazine in 2005. He is currently hard at work on a new novel called <em>Origin</em> which is set to be released on October 3, 2017.</p>
