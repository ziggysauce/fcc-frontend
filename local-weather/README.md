# Show the Local Weather

## Objective
Build an app that is functionally similar to this: http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV.

## Requirements
* User Story: I can see the weather in my current location.

* User Story: I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.

* User Story: I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

## Deployment
* Open index.html

## Launch
[Local Weather App](https://ziggysauce.github.io/fcc-frontend/local-weather/)

## Notes
[Medium Article](https://medium.com/chingu-fcc-speedrun/fcc-speedrun-local-weather-app-43053a11472a)

Created a local weather app that gets IP address information using https://ipapi.co/ geolocation API as well as OpenWeatherMap API to get weather information. The user can click the "F" or "C" button to toggle between measurement units (F/C and mi/km) for the temperature and wind speed. For the weather icons, https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/ was used to generate a different icon depending on the current weather description.
