# Build a Wikipedia Viewer

## Objective

Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/wGqEga/.

## Requirements

* User Story: I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.

* User Story: I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.

**Hint #1:** Here's a URL you can use to get a random Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random.

**Hint #2:** Here's an entry on using Wikipedia's API: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page.

**Hint #3:** Use this link to experiment with Wikipedia's API.

## Deployment

* Open index.html

## Launch

[Wikipedia Viewer](https://ziggysauce.github.io/chingu-fcc-speedrun-challenge/frontend/wikipedia-viewer/)


## Notes
[Medium Article](https://medium.com/@ziggysauce/fcc-speedrun-wikipedia-viewer-7da5cf72e4b1)

Created a wikipedia viewer app that uses the Wikipedia API to generate linked articles for the user based on the input submitted. The user can also click a button to be directed to a random wikipedia article. 

Mobile response has bugs when viewed on codepen.io, but otherwise should operate as intended.
